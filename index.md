- add hints for semantic references to be translated into RDFa to Markdown
  - this need not be generic from the start
  - specific tags for specific entities, e.g. `[+Ben]` to create a semantic reference to Ben
- query an index for suggested terms to semantically mark up
  - fill the index with labels from entities in the knowledge base
